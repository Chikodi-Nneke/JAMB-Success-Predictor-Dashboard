# JAMB Success Predictor Dashboard

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI dashboard and accompanying Python data preparation scripts, designed to analyse the profound impact of key student background factors (such as socioeconomic status, parental education, attendance, and study time) on overall student performance in the JAMB examination. This projects aims to identify key student background factors (such as socioeconomic status, parental education, attendance, and study time) that most strongly influence JAMB exam success.


## Goal

Students often face significant challenges in achieving optimal performance in the JAMB examination, impacting their educational progression and future opportunities. This project was proposed to provide a clear, data-driven understanding of the underlying student background factors influencing JAMB performance. Consequently, it empowers education policymakers and school administrators to make data-driven decisions and craft targeted interventions that significantly improve student outcomes and enhance overall school performance. Ultimately, this robust tool champions the use of data-driven strategies to optimize resource allocation and foster superior educational achievements for all students.


## Features

- Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Features dynamic filters by gender, school location, and school type allowing for granular analysis.
- Python Data Preparation Scripts: Python scripts for data transformation and predictive modeliing of performance data.
- Custom DAX Measures: Utilizes custom DAX measures within Power BI to calculate key performance indicators, such as the percentage of students meeting specific score thresholds and top performing student groups.


## Data

The analysis utilises a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle for tudent perfromance in JAM 2024, comprising 17 columns of student performance and background information. Key fields include: Gender, Age, JAMB Scores, Socioeconomic Status, Parental Education Level, Attendance Rate, and Weekly Study Hours. All sensitive data has been anonymized to ensure privacy.


## Usage 

- Use Power Query to clean and prepare the raw CSV data file.
- Open JAMBStudentDashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
- Use the dashboard slicers to filter by gender, school location, and school type.
